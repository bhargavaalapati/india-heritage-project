## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally for development and testing.

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- Python (v3.9 or newer) & `pip`
- A MongoDB Atlas account and connection string.

### **Backend Setup**

1.  Navigate to the `/backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` root and add your configuration:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string"
    DB_NAME="IndiVerseDB"
    SECRET_KEY="a_strong_random_secret_key_for_jwt"
    ```

### **Frontend Setup**

1.  In a new terminal, navigate to the `/frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### **Running the Application**

You will need two separate terminals running simultaneously.

- **Terminal 1: Start the Backend**

  ```bash
  cd backend
  source venv/bin/activate # Or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
  python app.py
  ```

  The backend API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

- **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend**

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run dev
  ```

  The frontend application will be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **File Uploads**: Implement file storage (e.g., using AWS S3 or Cloudinary) to allow users to upload images directly from their devices instead of using URLs.
- **Password Reset**: Add a "Forgot Password" feature that sends a secure reset link to the user's email.
- **Enhanced Chatbot**: Integrate a proper NLP (Natural Language Processing) service to improve the chatbot's conversational abilities.
- **User Profiles**: Create dedicated user profile pages where users can see all their posts and activity.
