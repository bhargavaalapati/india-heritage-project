## üîê API Endpoints

The backend REST API provides several endpoints to support the application's features. Routes requiring authentication must include a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.

| Endpoint                   | Method        | Auth Required? | Description                             |
| :------------------------- | :------------ | :------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `/api/auth/register`       | `POST`        | No             | Creates a new user.                     |
| `/api/auth/login`          | `POST`        | No             | Authenticates a user and returns a JWT. |
| `/api/auth/me`             | `GET`         | Yes            | Retrieves the current user's data.      |
| `/api/posts`               | `GET`, `POST` | `POST`: Yes    | Fetches or creates community posts.     |
| `/api/posts/<id>`          | `DELETE`      | Yes            | Deletes a post owned by the user.       |
| `/api/posts/<id>/like`     | `PATCH`       | Yes            | Likes/unlikes a post.                   |

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **Direct File Uploads**: Implement a cloud storage solution (like AWS S3 or Cloudinary) to allow users to upload images directly instead of just using URLs.
- **Expand AR Library**: Integrate more 3D models and AR experiences for a wider range of heritage sites.
- **Real-time Chat**: Upgrade the chatbot or community feed with WebSockets for real-time communication.
- **User Profile Pages**: Create dedicated profile pages for users to view their posts and activity.
